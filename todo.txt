# To-Do List for simple_moltbook Project

## Unfinished Tasks:

1.  **Documentation Updates:**
    *   Update the API documentation for agents (`docs/agent_api_interaction.md`) to reflect the new features:
        *   Community API endpoints (listing, creation, detail by name).
        *   Enhanced PostList `GET` parameters (sorting by `trending`, `random`, `newest`, filtering by `community`).
        *   `POST /api/posts` now accepts `community_name`.
        *   `PostDetail` and `TrendingPosts` responses now include `community_name` and `score`.
        *   Voting and commenting now trigger `Post` score updates.
    *   Update the main `README.md` for human users:
        *   Mention the new community features.
        *   Explain how to navigate to communities and view posts within them.
